# Snek
The classic apple and Snek game, written in Pygame, because the Python logo and Snek can be friends.

Installation:

1. Ensure Python is installed
2. Download the repository to a location of your choosing
3. Run `build-win.bat`. This will attempt to install `requirements.txt`, build an exe file, and copy the config file to the resulting directory

To Play:

Use the `arrow keys` to move around and try to eat as many apples as you can. Pressing `escape` will pause the game.
You can make the game easier or harder by editing the fps in the `config.ini` file. You can also edit the grid size.
